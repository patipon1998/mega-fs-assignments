# **Algorithm Part**

## **How to run the project**

> **This project is implemented with Python3. Make sure you have Python3 installed in your machine.**

1. Open Terminal and change directory to `<repository_root>/algo` .

2. Run the code file `index.py` within the directory with Python3. You may follow the command below.

    > `python index.py`
    >
    > *or some of you may need to use `python3` command*
    >
    > `python3 index.py`

3. Once the program is run, it will ask you to type the inputs.
    * The program will ask you to input a word list. To add a word list, type multiple words separated by white space as the example below, then hit enter.
        > ab bc cd
    * After you input word list, the program will ask you to input target word, type your target word as the example below, then hit enter.
        > abcd

4. The program will solve the inputs and print the answer. Once the answer is printed, the program terminates.
